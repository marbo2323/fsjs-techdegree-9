## Description

Project 9 for full-stack JavaScript developer Teamtreehouse's technical degree program.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- This application requires Node.js. If you don't have Node.js installed, install it from [nodejs downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) by selecting the appropriate version for your operating system.
- From your command line or terminal, install all dependencies using `npm install` command. 
- The project uses [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for development. Run `npm run seed` to create the database and seed it with data. This command creates the database file `fsjstd-restapi.db`.


## Run App

Use `npm start` to start the application on localhost:5000.

### Testing endpoints

In the root folder of the project is the Postman collection `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json`, which can be imported into the [Postman application](https://www.postman.com/). It can be used to manually test endpoints.
